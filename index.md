I am a Eletrical Engineer major at CSUF and I plan on gradruating in 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6, part 1
This Lab was the first one that I really enjoyed because of my lab partner and the code that we 
had to do.The first part in sandwich.cc  described how to create a sandwich and what it is needed inside of it.During the first part it introduced us to vectors and how to set the command line size, to the maximum size of 4 and if it was greater it will notify you about a error.On part 2 of blackjack_function.cc I enjoyed creating functions of particular cards and initialize them to certain amount of points.Certain cards contained more than others but the goal for the player is to get exactly 21 or close to it. The code contains booleans and for loops the most and  for each card function and card points and if it passes 21 then the function Isbust will show up.

Lab 7, part 1 
This particular lab I had fun designing the code with my partner because it related to real life situations. The code that we had to design was about parking a certain amount of time. We had to identify the days when parking wasnt available for each parking area and we had to create a lot of if statements for the name of the street, the day of the week. We also had to provide a lot of booleans and do mathematics in our code. The code had to  provide the time between when you were not available to park and return if you were able to park there or not.In parking_futction.cc we had  to create separate functions of each parking area and set up the time and day when they were not available to park.

Lab 10, part 1
This Lab intrigued me the most from the other ones that I have done because it was the most simple but complex code that I have done. There was only one file (counties_functions.cc)  we had to code and at first glance it seemed really easy but what made it confusing was the 2D vector we had to create for the counties, the population that each county has and the population of the states of each county there.Another,thing that I had trouble with was indexing the size while using std: stoi because it gave us a error which we both had trouble figuring out ourselves. Eventually, we had to ask the TA (Franki) to help us fix the problem by fixing the invalid argument.
